<h2>Educational Background</h2>
<li>Elementary:
		Benguet Learners Center is where I studied grades 1 - 4 where I am one of the top students and transfered to Cordillera Career Development College(CCDC) where my education crumbled. I graduated elementary in Cordillera Career Development College. I dont have that much achievements or any honorable mentions. I got carried by "barkadas" and friends, and started playing PC games. </li>
<li>Highschool:
		From elementary to highschool, my grades went down and down but thankfully I got no failing grades and failing subjects. Highschool is one of  my most boring part of my life as of now, and transfered schools 3 times. I graduated at Rizal National Highschool.
		I transferred here because it is a walking distance away from home.
		</li>
<li>College:
		Starting from college, where it is another stepping stone of growing up. I went to UB first because I got the scholarship and took up the course of Civil Engineering, before I started studying here in UC and currently taking up Information Technology.
